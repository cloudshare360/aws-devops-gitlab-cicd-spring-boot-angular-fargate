## Learning Preferences & Patterns

### Effective Approaches
✅ **Sequential Learning**: Prefers step-by-step, ordered progression  
✅ **Practical Focus**: Wants hands-on labs and real-world applications  
✅ **Immediate Application**: Values skills that can be used right away  
✅ **Structured Organization**: Appreciates clear folder hierarchies and documentation  
✅ **Prerequisites Mapping**: Wants to know what knowledge is required before each topic  
✅ **Progress Tracking**: Values milestones, checklists, and success metrics  

### Avoid
❌ **Theoretical Deep-Dives**: Without practical application  
❌ **Overwhelming Complexity**: Too many concepts at once  
❌ **Scattered Information**: Prefers organized, hierarchical structure
